Problem 1:
Run the markov_cpptest.sh script will run all versions of the markov++.cpp file automatically with each of them timed.
Problem 2:
I am not quite sure what kind of test should be performed to the modification. So only a Makefile is attached, there is no test script command associated with this one.
Problem 3:
The Makefile only compile the C version and C++ version. The Java version can be run using the “java” command directly.
